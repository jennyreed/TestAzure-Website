                 and intimate private dining room.
                 Gerome is greek, and the bathrooms are nicer than most restaurants
                  . The polished tiles, shiny brass fittings, and velvet
                   booths complete the luxurious fit-out, but it doesn’t feel pretentious.

              Split into various nooks and rooms both upstairs and down, 
              it has been converted into a bunker-style restaurant that
               draws inspiration from both of its cuisine’s homage. Paper

               expect surprises and where else, but away from home.
                Probably why each interior in the modern hospitality
                 industry is very different from the next. Creative offices
                  for business travelers, interesting looking TV panels and 
                  an extra sofa next to the king-sized bed are just some of 
                  the key “ingredients” for a trendy hotel room. We’ve also
                   seen color explosions and eclectic decor mixes, which can
                    definitely appeal to guests wanting to experience unique accommodation.

               This “principle” was well integrated in the array

                struggle to keep the indoor outdoor transition
                 as “ethereal” as possible. Not only are hotel
                  rooms expanded through large decks and terraces, 
                  but nature is brought inside in every possible way. 
                  Wood paneling, stone decorations, lush greenery, 
                  indoor waterfalls- these are just some of the elements

              we need to do even more to reduce our carbon footprint 
              and build a more sustainable future. So, it’s no surprise
               that sustainable design practices and materials are a
                huge office design trend of 2021.<br>
                We focused on using raw, clean materials and worked 
                closely with the existing building to limit the need
                 for virgin materials. The chairs are made from 100% 
                 recycled ocean plastic and the teapoint is clad in
                  5,000 recycled yoghurt pots. This office design 
                  trend isn’t just here for now – it’s here for the future.

            <p class="card-text">It’s no longer enough for offices to be offices. 
              They have to be smart offices. Remote working has 
              solidified our reliance on digital information and 
              the Internet of Things. Smart workspace uses digital
               sensors to monitor and respond to things like occupancy, 
               air quality, natural light levels and more.<br>
               Smart buildings can collect and share data, 
               enabling companies to better understand when
                and how different spaces are being used. 
                This is an incredibly powerful tool for 
                office design, and has special relevance in the 
                context of social distancing and COVID-security,
                 as well as being a great help in space rationalisation.

               for everything. If you want your business to continue to 
               attract top talent, it’s time to invest in this office design trend.<br>
               2020 has proved that many of us are able to work from anywhere,
                but if you’d like to encourage people in their return to work, 
                your business also needs to be smart with its workplace design. 
                Instead of simply thinking ‘we need x number of desks’, it’s 
                time to consider how your space can be used to encourage different ways of working.

                often means you combine all the items you’ve 
                collected over the years. Does that always perfectly
                 match? No probably not, but a home with items with 
                 a story, a nice memorie or simply because you think
                  it’s pretty will feel more like a home to you than
                   the perfectly designed home.

             Add depth and texture to your wall for a unique
              wall feature. There are many tutorials on the 
              internet that can show you how to create such 
              a wall. You can add the wooden slats in interesting 
              geometric forms or go for a more traditional box paneling.
